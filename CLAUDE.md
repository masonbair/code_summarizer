## AI Agent Instructions

### Available Custom Tooling

This project is configured with custom AI-agent tooling. **Before starting work, read `.ai/TOOLS.md`** to understand available commands.


Quick reference:
- Symbol lookup: See `.ai/TOOLS.md` for CodeIndex usage



### Project Conventions

See `.ai/CONVENTIONS.md` for:
- Code style guidelines
- Architecture patterns
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards

### Context Files

The `.ai/` directory contains AI-optimized context:
- `TOOLS.md` - Available custom tooling
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and structure
- `CONVENTIONS.md` - Project-specific conventions
- `context/` - Auto-generated context files (created by tools)

**IMPORTANT:** Always check these files before starting implementation work.

## Development Workflow

1. Read `.ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand system structure
2. Use custom tools (see `.ai/TOOLS.md`) for context gathering
3. Follow conventions in `.ai/CONVENTIONS.md`
4. Update architecture docs when making structural changes

## For AI Agents: Tool Discovery

Available custom tools are registered in `.ai/TOOLS.md`. These tools are designed to help you:
- **Understand code faster** (semantic search, AST analysis)
- **Use context efficiently** (summarization, smart packing)
- **Navigate large codebases** (dependency graphs, call hierarchies)

Read `.ai/TOOLS.md` FIRST before performing any code analysis or context gathering.
